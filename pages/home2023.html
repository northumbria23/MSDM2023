Karl Tuyls "Complex Dynamics of Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making"<br>

      <br>

In this talk I will introduce and discuss the complex dynamics that
arise when multiple agents make decisions in complex dynamic
situations, which require them to be adaptive or learn. For this
purpose we will investigate Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary
Game Theory, and summarize some of the recent results obtained with
these techniques at the RAI research group of Maastricht University. In
the first part of the talk I will formally connect Reinforcement
Learning to Evolutionary Game Theory using a variety of Replicator
Dynamics models. The Replicator Dynamics are a central concept from
Evolutionary Game Theory that describe how a population of strategies
evolves through time using biological operators such as selection and
mutation. We will both examine this relationship for stateless and
multi-state games, and investigate the intricacies of the dynamics that
arise from multiple concurrently learning agents. Using this relation
we investigate what Evolutionary Game Theory tells us about multi-agent
learning, and illustrate how e.g. parameters can be tuned and new
learning algorithms can be designed. In the second part of the talk I
will illustrate this work in classical game theoretic settings,
continuous double auctions and No Limit Texas Hold'em Poker.

      <p><b><font size="+2">Workshop Overview</font></b><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a></p>

      <div align="justify">Multiagent sequential decision making under uncertainty (MSDM) is the problem multiple agents face when they aim to optimise their decisions over a finite or infinite number of time steps in a stochastic environment. It becomes increasingly complex when there is limited communication among the agents and the agents would act subjectively in a real-time interaction. The research problem is one of the core challenging issues in the agents planning community where researchers have developed a significant amount of research in the past decades. For example, a number of multiagent decision models, e.g. Dec-POMDP, MMDP and I-POMDP, have been well developed while a variety of different algorithms have been crafted to solve the models with the consideration of tractable computational complexity. However, the research challenges still exist particularly in an open AI world where unknown unknowns further complicate the agents’ interactions in both offline agent model and online plan execution.<br>

      <br>

The purpose of this workshop is to revisit the previous research achievements and discuss potential solutions to the new challenges in the MSDM research. Meanwhile, it is noticed that data-driven AI with powerful deep learning have dramatically changed the AI research horizon, which also offers great opportunities to re-shape the MSDM research. Hence, this workshop aims to bring together researchers in the fields of agents planning, reasoning and learning, as well as general machine learning and data science. We expect to discuss new MSDM solutions and foster research collaboration so as to demonstrate the MSDM research in a set of impactful real-world applications, e.g. health, space, security and so on. </div>
